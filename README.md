# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. 
The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

* Download and unzip the data
* Read the data (training and test datasets)
* Merge the training and the test sets to create one dataset
* Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data se
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
* Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
* The end result is shown in the file tidy_dataset.txt
