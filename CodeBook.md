This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in tidy_dataset.txt.

The variables are classified in two domains, for a given subject and activity:
* Time-domain signals
* Frequency-domain signals

## Time-domain Signals in X, Y and Z directions:

* Average body acceleration (timeBodyAccmeanX, timeBodyAccmeanY, timeBodyAccmeanZ)
* Standard deviation of the body acceleration (timeBodyAccstdX, timeBodyAccstdY, timeBodyAccstdZ )
* Average gravity acceleration (timeGravityAccmeanX, timeGravityAccmeanY, timeGravityAccmeanZ )
* Standard deviation of the gravity acceleration (timeGravityAccstdX, timeGravityAccstdY, timeGravityAccstdZ)
* Average body acceleration jerk (timeBodyAccJerkmeanX, timeBodyAccJerkmeanY, timeBodyAccJerkmeanZ)
* Standard deviation of the body acceleration jerk (timeBodyAccJerkstdY, timeBodyAccJerkstdY, timeBodyAccJerkstdZ)
* Average body angular velocity (timeBodyGyromeanX, timeBodyGyromeanY, timeBodyGyromeanZ) 
* Standard deviation of body angular velocity (timeBodyGyrostdX, timeBodyGyrostdY, timeBodyGyrostdZ)
* Average body angular velocity jerk (timeBodyGyroJerkmeanX, timeBodyGyroJerkmeanY, timeBodyGyroJerkmeanZ)
* Standard deviation of the body angular velocity jerk (timeBodyGyroJerkstdX, timeBodyGyroJerkstdY, timeBodyGyroJerkstdZ)
* Average and standard deviation of the magnitude of body acceleration (timeBodyAccMagmean, timeBodyAccMagstd)
* Average and standard deviation of the magnitude of gravity acceleration (timeGravityAccMagmean, timeGravityAccMagstd)
* Average and standard deviation of the magnitude of body acceleration jerk (timeBodyAccJerkMagmean, timeBodyAccJerkMagstd)
* Average and standard deviation of the magnitude of body angular velocity (timeBodyGyroMagmean, timeBodyGyroMagstd)
* Average and standard deviation of the magnitude of body angular velocity jerk (timeBodyGyroJerkMagmean, timeBodyGyroJerkMagstd)

## Frequency-domain Signals in X, Y and Z directions:

* Average body acceleration (frequencyBodyAccmeanX, frequencyBodyAccmeanY, frequencyBodyAccmeanZ)
* Standard deviation of the body acceleration (frequencyBodyAccstdX, frequencyBodyAccstdY, frequencyBodyAccstdZ)
* Weighted average of the frequency components of the body acceleration (frequencyBodyAccmeanFreqX, frequencyBodyAccmeanFreqY, frequencyBodyAccmeanFreqZ)
* Average body acceleration jerk (frequencyBodyAccJerkmeanX, frequencyBodyAccJerkmeanY, frequencyBodyAccJerkmeanZ)
* Standard deviation of the body acceleration jerk (frequencyBodyAccJerkstdX, frequencyBodyAccJerkstdY, frequencyBodyAccJerkstdZ)
* Weighted average of the frequency components of the body acceleration jerk (frequencyBodyAccJerkmeanFreqX, frequencyBodyAccJerkmeanFreqY, frequencyBodyAccJerkmeanFreqZ)
* Average body angular velocity (frequencyBodyGyromeanX, frequencyBodyGyromeanY, frequencyBodyGyromeanZ )
* Standard deviation of the body angular velocity (frequencyBodyGyrostdX, frequencyBodyGyrostdY, frequencyBodyGyrostdZ)
* Weighted average of the frequency components of the body angular velocity (frequencyBodyGyromeanFreqX, frequencyBodyGyromeanFreqY, frequencyBodyGyromeanFreqZ)
* Average, standard deviation and weighted average of the frequency components of the magnitude of body acceleration (frequencyBodyAccMagmean, frequencyBodyAccMagstd, frequencyBodyAccMagmeanFreq)
* Average, standard deviation, and weighted average of the frequency components of the magnitude of body acceleration jerk (frequencyBodyAccJerkMagmean, frequencyBodyAccJerkMagstd, frequencyBodyAccJerkMagmeanFreq)
* Average, standard deviation, and weighted average of the frequency components of the magnitude of body angular velocity (frequencyBodyGyroMagmean, frequencyBodyGyroMagstd, frequencyBodyGyroMagmeanFreq)
* Average, standard deviation, and weighted average of the frequency components of the magnitude of body angular velocity jerk (frequencyBodyGyroJerkMagmean, frequencyBodyGyroJerkMagstd, frequencyBodyGyroJerkMagmeanFreq)
